 	    My name is M.Nasywan Wafa Zahran , i'm 16 years old while i write this biography. 
 	i'm the only child in my family , and ofcourse i dont have a brother or sister. 
 	Sometimes thats make me feel lonely at home.
 	    I live at Sindang Barang Loji , West Bogor with my lovely parents and i was studying in Bogor 
 	Vocational Highschool of Chemical Analyst (SMAKBO). Now i'm in second 
 	year . I have many hobbies, like Drawing , read a book about science (especially microbiology), 
 	watching an anime and playing a game. but the most of my favorite hobby is drawing, because i learnt it 
 	since i was 9 years old until now. I have collected many comics as reference for my drawing skills and 
 	also i bought drawing tools too. And i have spent all of my savings money for 6 months, for bought a pen 
 	tab but i rarely to used it. Beacuse i'm too busy for doing my school tasks.
 		The last thing is my life motto, i get this motto from an anime character. She is Erza Scarlet from Fairy Tail
 	series,i like this quote because it's represent of my life now. Especially my fisrt month in SMAKBO, i can't 
 	handle many school tasks, and this quote make me think to be stronger person to pass many obstacles.
